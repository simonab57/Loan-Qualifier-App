# Project Title: Loan Qualifier App

The background of this project takes place in a fintech lending statup in which their BizOps wants us to add a new feature to our software. Hence, this project's main focus is to create a new feature that prompts a user to save qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

## Technologies

The technology that was required for this project was Python and Github. In which our first step was to create a GitHub repository that included the primary application file, data csv, filers, utils, and a README.md. Some of the techniques that were used included save_csv functions, questionary, and git commands.
